# variable
# a variable is like a box having a name on it and having a value inside it

# no spacing
a = 3   #integer can be -
b = "hi" #string
c = 3.5 #float
d = -5.97 #float
e = True #boolean

# prove that a is a integer

print(type(a)) #we want the type of a
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))
print(type(e))

# Assignment
x = "Ron"
y = 'Ron'
# Are x and y both strings? Prove it?
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
# this proves that the 2 types of quotation marks are the same

# conclusion=> "" or '' are the same
